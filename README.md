# JavaScript-Interactive-Website-3
Handlebars


Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The home and store pages already have most of the HTML and CSS set up. Your job is to make the following changes:

    Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
    Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
    Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
    Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
